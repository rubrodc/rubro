# CX Metrics

## NPS

Net Promoter Score is a customer loyalty metric that can be used in any market segment, bringing reflections on the customer's experience and satisfaction. It is widely used as a KPI due to it's simplicity, flexibility and trustfulness. NPS is measured in a -100 to 100 index.

## CSAT
Customer Satisfaction Score is a widely used metric, measuring the quality of services and products of any type of business. CSAT is represented on a percentage scale from 0% to 100%.

## CES
The Customer Effort Score measures the effort of a customer when realizing an action with your brand. The lower the effort, the higher the chances of increasing the loyalty.  In this case, the easiest the action, the higher the chances of loyalty.

## Ratings
Ratings are a simplified alternative to CSAT, being represented on a star-based scale. They are also known as micro feedback, being answered at the right point of the customer journey in an agile manner without affecting the customer experience.

## Like/Dislike
Like/Dislike is a simple micro feedback metric that quickly measures the sentiment on a specific experience. With a practical, direct and attractive visual, it helps to gather information with little to no effort from your customer.
