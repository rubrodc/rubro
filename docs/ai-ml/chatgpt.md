```mkd title="Create a user flow for a job searching app"
Sure, here's an example user flow for a job searching app:

1. Landing page: The user opens the app and lands on the home screen where they see options to search for jobs or create a profile.
2. Search for jobs: The user clicks on "Search for jobs" and is directed to a page where they can search for jobs based on job title, location, and/or keywords.
3. Job listing: The app displays a list of relevant job openings based on the user's search criteria. Each listing shows the job title, company, location, and a brief job description.
4. Job details: The user clicks on a job listing to view more details about the job, including the job requirements, qualifications, and how to apply for the job.
5. Save job: If the user is interested in the job, they can save it to their list of favorite jobs to apply for later.
6. Apply for job: The user clicks on the "Apply" button, which takes them to the application page. Here, the user can upload their resume, cover letter, and any other required documents and submit their application.
7. Profile creation: If the user chooses to create a profile, they will be prompted to fill out their personal information, work experience, education, skills, and other relevant details to help them find job openings that match their qualifications.
8. Job recommendations: Based on the user's profile, the app will suggest job openings that are a good match for their skills and experience.
9. Apply for recommended jobs: The user can view the recommended jobs and apply for any that they are interested in.
10. Application history: The user can view their application history to keep track of the jobs they have applied for, the status of their applications, and any feedback they have received.

This is just one example of a user flow for a job searching app, and the specific steps and features may vary depending on the app's design and functionality.
