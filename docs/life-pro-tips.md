# Life Pro Tips

## General

## Cleaning

- Have a designated spot for every single item (Put it in the same place every time)

## Internet

- When you are cleaning your email inbox, search by terms like 'discount', 'last chance', '$', 'special offer', etc. It will save you a lot of time and often lead to other emails that you want to erase.

## Memory
- Park in the same place every time when you go to a common place. You won’t forget where you park that way
- Use voice assistants. “Remind me to do X tomorrow at Y time”
- Make a calendar entry for every scheduled thing religiously. Make the calendar entry immediately while making the appointment. Do this for parties, birthdays, dates, finals, med refills, trash night, etc.

## Getting things done
- Remember that something is better than nothing. If you only get 26% of a task done then it’s further than if you never started. It’s better to do little bits of every task rather than procrastinating.
