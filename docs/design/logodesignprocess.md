# Logo Design Process

## Project Goals
Our aim is to hit as many as possible. The final logo won’t check every box, and that’s ok.

- [ ] works well with the existing collateral
- [ ] Works well at all sizes
- [ ] Stands up to the competition
- [ ] Simple
- [ ] Easily recognizable
- [ ] Connects to our company values

## Creative Directions
We approached the logo mark by focusing on and exploring 3 creative directions:

**A. Geometric Shapes**  
Unique, abstract shapes that compliment the adjoining typeface

**B. Metaphors**  
Symbols that have a loose association with our new name

**C. Abstract “S”**  
Creative solution to incorporate the letter “S” as a logo mark
