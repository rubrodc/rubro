## The importance of end-to-end encryption
End-to-end encryption ensures the security of your data by encrypting and decrypting it exclusively at the "end points". This means that intermediaries, such as service providers, cannot access the encryption keys and cannot read the data.

In essence, end-to-end encryption safeguards your information from unintended access.
