- Follow a diet

- Do breathing techniques (eg. Wim Hof Method)
- Go outside for a moment

## Advices
- Don't be embarrassed of your situation. Half of these people are covering up the same situations with filters and smiles. Make a plan, cut off distractions, stay focused and execute consistently. You'll make it. I promise.

- "The only day I hate is my birthday, because everyone acts like they care."

- It's crazy, working on yourself never ends. You get better then BOOM...a new level unlocks and you have to start working on yourself again. That's actually a major KEY to success, getting used to the constant pursuit of growth and never quitting on yourself.

- Your bag says Prada, but your brokerage shows nada.
Don't stay broke trying to look rich; that's just stupid.

- So many people from your past know a version of you that no longer exists anymore. Sometimes growth requires new company, new locations, and new mindsets.

- They weren't sorry until you found out ...
Keep that in mind


- Imagine playing monopoly and never buying anything that could produce more $ Just collecting your $200 for passing by. This is how most people live their lives

I'm 40. This is my input.

1. Falling out of love is perhaps more powerful than falling in love.
1. Use up ALL of your vacation time / sick time at work.
